Readme about the ssh keys
*************************


All private keys that end with *id_rsa will be added to the ssh agent.

However, having a lot of keys in the agent causes the ssh authentication to fail before all the keys
are tried. Hence we are limiting them from being added to the agent by renaming them to
id_rsa.private from id_rsa. 

When you need them rename and add it back or restart ssh agent
