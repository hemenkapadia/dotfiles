Readme about the ssh keys
*************************

>> All private keys that end with *.agent_add will be added to the ssh agent.

>> Having many keys in agent causes ssh auth to fail as multiple wrong keys are tried before the right one is reached.
>> Keys are added in start_agent function in ~/.bash_functions
>> Use the above mentioned file naming convention to manage the keys added to agent at the start of the first bash shell
>> to reload files in ssh-agent
  - first kill existing agent instance with `pkill -9 ssh-agent`
  - use the bash function `start_agent`
